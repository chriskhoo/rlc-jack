First attempt at building a chatbot. 
Slackbot built using botkit (and clever bot). 
Cleverbot does not seem to function as expected and I would suggest building the conversations using botkit, and perhaps natural language processors as middleware. 

If heavy customization is not essential and AI is preferred, you might consider api.ai. 
A sample bot can be found [here](https://chriskhoo.github.io/luigi-pasta/) .

Tutorials were used as a basis for this application: 
- [altitude labs](http://altitudelabs.com/blog/create-a-slackbot-using-botkit/) (note, out of date and it's best to reference [botkit readme](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) 
- [beginner's guide](https://slackhq.com/a-beginner-s-guide-to-your-first-bot-97e5b0b7843d#.lqtpsn2es)
